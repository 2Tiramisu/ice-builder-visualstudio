# Ice Builder for Visual Studio

The Ice Builder for Visual Studio manages the compilation of Slice (`.ice`) files to C++ and C#. It recompiles automatically Slice files that have changed, keeps track of dependencies between Slice files to recompile dependent files, and removes generated files that have become obsolete.
